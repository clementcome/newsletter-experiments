## Experiments Directory

This repository contains an `experiments` directory with self-contained subfolders for each experiment. Each subfolder includes its own requirements, script/notebook, input, and output.

### Navigating the Experiments Directory

1. Go to the `experiments` directory.
2. Each subfolder within the `experiments` directory corresponds to a specific experiment.
3. Inside each subfolder, you will find:
   - `requirements.txt`: Lists the dependencies required for the experiment.
   - `script.py` or `notebook.ipynb`: Contains the main script or notebook for the experiment.
   - `input`: Directory containing input data for the experiment.
   - `output`: Directory where the output data/results of the experiment are stored.

### Example

For example, the `experiment1` subfolder contains:
- `requirements.txt`: Lists dependencies like numpy, pandas, matplotlib, scikit-learn.
- `script.py`: Main script for the experiment.
- `input`: Directory containing input data (e.g., `data.csv`).
- `output`: Directory where the output data/results (e.g., `results.png`) are stored.
